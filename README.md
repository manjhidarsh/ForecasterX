# ForecasterX : Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

ForecasterX is a data-driven pipeline that leverages time series forecasting and inventory theory to optimize product supply strategies. Built with Python, it combines statistical modeling and visualization to support better inventory and demand planning decisions.

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **SARIMA** (Statsmodels), **Prophet**
- **Plotly**, **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn** for model evaluation
- **Newsvendor model** for inventory optimization

##  Key Features
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicts daily product demand using SARIMA and Prophet with performance metrics (MAPE, RMSE).
- **Inventory Optimization**: Implements the Newsvendor model to determine reorder points, safety stock, and optimal order quantity.
- **Cost Analysis**: Calculates total inventory cost, balancing holding and stockout costs.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualizes demand and inventory trends with Plotly for actionable insights.

##  Forecasting Models
- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**: Captures seasonal patterns and trends in demand.
- **Prophet**: Provides robust forecasts with daily seasonality and trend components.

##  Inventory Strategy
- **Reorder Point Calculation**
- **Safety Stock Estimation**
- **Total Cost Minimization** using inventory simulations
